        "description": "BlueJ is a development environment that allows you to develop Java programs quickly and easily. Its main features are that it is:<br/>\n<li>Simple. BlueJ has a deliberately smaller and simpler interface than professional environments like NetBeans or Eclipse. This allows beginners to get started more quickly, and without being overwhelmed.\n</li><li>Designed for teaching. BlueJ is deliberately designed with good pedagogy in mind. There is a popular textbook designed for teaching introductory university/college courses with BlueJ, and a site full of teaching resources.\n</li><li>Interactive. BlueJ allows you to interact with objects. You can inspect their value, call methods on them, pass them as parameters and more. You can also directly invoke Java expressions without compiling. Thus BlueJ is a powerful graphical shell/REPL for Java.\n</li><li>Portable. BlueJ runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and other platforms which run Java. It can also run without installation from a USB stick.\n</li><li>Mature. BlueJ is over fifteen years old, but continues to be updated and supported by a full-time team. We aim to respond to all technical support requests within one working day.\n</li><li>Innovative. BlueJ has several features not seen before in other IDEs. Its object bench, code pad, and scope colouring were all original BlueJ features.</li>",

You enter the specification through the truth table. The moment you click on a cell, the corresponding cell on the Karnaugh map also gets updated. Alternatively, you may enter data into the Karnaugh map directly. If you do so, the truth table will be updated real-time to reflect the Karnaugh map. The program constantly updates the screen, drawing the largest circle around the group of adjacent bits. The output box always displays the prime implicant solution. KarnaughMap 1.31 is a stand-alone Win32 executable that requires no DLLs to run. No Unzipping or installation required. Does not write to the registry; uninstallation is done by deleting the exe file.Extremely intuitive and convenient. A must-have tool for the freshmen electrical engineering student.",

With SimTraffic, individual vehicles are modeled and displayed traversing a street network. SimTraffic models signalized and unsignalized intersections, as well as freeway sections with cars, trucks, pedestrians, and buses. Unlike a number of other modeling applications, SimTraffic animation is displayed while the simulation is performed. Data entry is intuitive and efficient. With a single mouse click, any data set created with Synchro can be used to run simulations within SimTraffic.",

Synchro also implements the Intersection Capacity Utilization method for determining intersection capacity. Synchro\u2019s signal optimization routine allows the user to weight specific phases, thus providing users more options when developing signal timing plans. Because the software is easy to use, traffic engineers are modeling within days, thus adding to the number of reasons why Synchro remains the leading traffic analysis application.",

The analyst can select the desired independent variable and then calculate driveway volumes by using the rates or equations found in the Trip Generation Manual. Pass-by trips and internal capture trips for mixed-use developments (NCHRP 684) can also be taken into account. The software allows users to enter custom trip rates based on local or regional studies. Several reports are available for users to quickly review calculations. Future versions of the software will be integrated with Synchro, thus significantly reducing the time required to analyze traffic impacts.",

Wholesaler quoted net prices can also be stored for each item.You may assign a markup to each catalogue item to allow Winpriser to calculate your selling price above cost.If you want to base your pricing on Allpriser list price less a markdown, you can also assign multiple markdowns to each price catalogue item.You maintain all of your discount, markup, markdown and labour rates in a rate sheet. Each rate sheet can be customized to your own specifications.The online Allpriser price catalogue is updated by subscribing to the Allpriser Computer Pricing Service. Updates can be delivered by mail on diskette or over the internet. As each of Allpriser\u2019s publications becomes available, a separate online price catalogue for each service will be accessible through Winpriser.\n\nIn addition to the traditional Allpriser online price catalogues, Winpriser allows an unlimited number of user created price catalogues. Each of these user price catalogues can be customized to accommodate your specialized product or inventory requirements.\n",
